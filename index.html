        <p>My design Fuego is an introductory coding assignment where I was able to learn the basics of html to produce a brief biographical piece of work. It required that I learn several new coding-based techniques like creating a Github repository, editing prefab code (and adding my own lines), as well as figuring out how to publish my work as a usable website.

This project required understanding how to design with a computer model and how to choose visual elements that represent myself professionally.</p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>The technology we’ve learned to use has allowed us to create pieces of work that goes beyond aesthetic appeal and engages deeper with the principles of design. Giving us a large array of typographical and coding-based assets, technology lets us customize and connect to our projects. In the “Good Design” project for example, by incorporating technical writing with stylized rhetoric to create concise but informative text, we could convey the principles of design in impactful ways. This project also emphasized the ethics of our work and how our designs can become more accessible to others that experience the world a bit differently. By incorporating the ideas of alignment, my descriptions of the good design principles serve the purpose of feeling intentional on a page without sacrificing the usability of the design to those such as people with dyslexia who have trouble reading center-alignment paragraphs. Each of these components separately can enhance a design, but meshing them together creates more creative and thoughtful outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Williams' principle of having control over something once you can name it resonated with me deeply with the design process. Coming into this class I had next to no experience in regards to graphic design but having learned the core principles I can apply them directly to my own work. I feel that this is especially powerful when it comes to critique during workshops where having the necessary vocabulary allowed me to know how to give feedback, giving others the support to lift up their creations. Naming the main design principles was also especially important in my “Good Design” project, being able to identify and categorize the important concepts of designs, allowing me to say how the alignment of the piece creates cohesion or how the contrast is important to the visual flow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>The ability to revise and reshape our work into the best that it can be rarely happens in isolation. The act of workshop, putting out what you have, even if it's not 100% of the way finished is imperative to the design process. During the good design workshop, I knew my technical writing needed to be honed in, but I created a basis of what I wanted and got feedback from my peers. As creators, we harbor biases towards our own work that get overlooked during the process of making, but showing others brings on fresh ideas, new perspectives, and respective critiques. It additionally fosters a space to ask for help with design, allowing us to gain support from each other in a safe environment where we create community and trust with others working on similar designs. I found it extremely helpful during the cartoon project to see what other people did for their assignments and having the ability to ask things like, “how did you get your facial expressions to convey so well over drawing”? Through these exchanges of ideas and mutual support, we become better designers in our own rites, but even more so, learn how to guide others in their design journey, just as they help us reach new levels within our own practice.</p>

              <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
              <p>No design is made perfect on the first go around and my work so far this semester is no exception. I have found that my most impactful revisions have been on projects such as “Good Design” where I had to revise both visual and textual elements. Stemming from skills learned during this project, it allowed me to return to past ones and employ these new insights. After learning more of InDeisign and some of the more technical skills required on Adobe, I was able to add onto my Cartoon project now that I was more comfortable with the tools. I also made use of the technical writing from “Good Design” on my UX study presentation, making sure to implement this toolset in all my work.</p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>Communication as a whole is an important skillset that I believe all people, but especially within my field of science need to be individual experts at. I thought that through presenting my UX study to my group I not only became more confident of the underlying principles of UX, but also on how to present designs to others. Other then orally, the ability to share your work from a portfolio standpoint, especially when building professional connections is imperative to success within the business sector. I found that through creating the Design Fuego and publishing it as a website, it was a first step for me to get my creative work out into the open.</p>

        <p>This two-page spread built on my existing InDesign skills by making me more conscious of tools like kerning and leading.

        <p>This infographic allowed me to encompass all the previously learned design principles and create my first ever original design from scratch. The project particularly emphasized writing for an audience in a persuasive manner, taking into account the Toulmin model for argumentation, providing claims, data, warrants, and rebuttals regarding genetically modified organisms.</p>

    </a>
       <p>I created this ad with the intention of it being a design in a scientific product magazine where I am selling cryogenic tubes. This project required that I shift my writing from purely active and direct information from previous projects to more casual and clever phrasing. I also put focus on the behavioral aspect of viewing this piece, trying to effectively lay it out in a way where your eyes move through the piece.</p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>In these pieces, the role of rhetoric conveys message through design and reaches a goal through leveraging such principles. For projects like the infographic or accessibility document, active writing promotes clear and effective information messaging. On the other hand, a project like the magazine ad required you to play with your wording a bit to generate catchy slogans. Wording like "Because room temperature isn’t an option” functions to catch your attention, but could potentially appear confusing in an infographic. Technology also enhances these principles by giving us access to tools which can create figures, diagrams, and illustrations to convey our rhetoric. Again, this works well to directly convey data in infographics and also lets us create interesting visuals for an advertisement.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>Design principles played their roles within these pieces, specifically for creating a visual flow. In the magazine ad I used the idea of contrast with the colors to move your eyes along the orange coloring of the page, starting with the title, moving down through the visual and finally at the brand name, bringing you to the body text. It familiarizes you with the topic and builds interest, then letting you learn more about my product. This enhanced the infographic where using the Toulmin principles, I stated my argument on GMOs in a way where the format of claim, evidence, and rebuttal moves you through the information.</p>
     </div>
 
     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>Workshops proved immensely helpful for this portfolio, specifically as we created original designs for the first time, mostly from scratch. Being in small groups for workshops throughout the semester allowed us to comfortably provide feedback, armed with the ability to provide advice, using the design language we now know. I remember in my first rendition of the magazine ad I came to the workshop not loving my design. Through peer feedback though I got concrete suggestions that makes the final version far more effective as an advertisement, and follows some of the design principles stronger. As we also learn more technologies, adding tools like photoshop now to the mix, it's important to engage in spaces where we can teach each other tips and tricks with these design technologies that we may not discover otherwise on our own.</p>

               <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
               <p>Going into the infographic project I found myself slightly intimidated, creating my first fully original design. After the workshop, I knew it needed a lot of revision but I sat on it for a few weeks, unsure exactly what to do. After completing both the advertisement and accessible PDF projects though I had a much better idea of how to leverage the design capabilities of InDesign and Photoshop to go back and revise my infographic. I found the importance of returning to older projects lies in the fact that we now possess a new range of tools and principles that we can implement in our earlier work that we had no idea existed at the time. This chain of finishing a project and using the skills within it on previous designs allows us to enhance our portfolios as a whole because each design can undergo continuous improvement.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
               <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
               <p>I had the opportunity to present my designs twice during this portfolio, first for the infographic and second for the advertisement. These sessions served imperative to the overall outcome of the designs as I gathered abundant feedback, having the entire class able to critique me at once. I even led a mock focus group for the advertisement, asking questions to the whole class that allowed me to direct the feedback towards uncovering faults in my piece. Through this I not only gathered important considerations on my designs but also became more confident in putting my work out there. In both of these instances I knew that what I showed needed work but I still presented, knowing I was going to get criticism and it helped me identify what did and didn’t work in my designs.</p>
